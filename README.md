Howdy, this is the page to download PDFs related to the Brown County CWDG Program.


If you want to see whether you are eligible to receive funding, click this link here: https://pecan-bayou-swcd.github.io/Tier-1-Projects-Map/ . If you are within the red boundary, you qualify for financial assistance for tree/shrub pruning. If you are in any of the other colored boundaries, you qualify for financial assistance for brush management/range planting (i.e. dozing, grubbing, mulching). More project areas will open up next year and the year after that, so if you aren't eligible now, you probably will be later if you are around Lake Brownwood or within or nearby to the cities of Brownwood, Early, Bangs, or Blanket. We're also funding brush management/range planting on Brown County road rights-of-way and Comanche Electric Cooperative power line rights-of-way in Brown County this year, so you might see some of that going on as well.

If you want to see how the program works, or at least how it is intended to work, look at the grant application we submitted in March 2025 by clicking "Brown County-Project Implementation (1).pdf".


This program is the result of Pecan Bayou Soil and Water Conservation District's winning grant application to the US Forest Service's Community Wildfire Defense Grant program. Our application was only possible because of help from Texas A&M Forest Service, Brown County Commissioners' Court, Brownwood Fire Department, Early Fire Department, volunteer fire departments throughout Brown County (in particular Lake Brownwood Fire Department, whose chief served as the VFD representative on the CWPP core working group), the cities of Brownwood, Early, Bangs, and Blanket, Brown County Water Improvement District #1, and Comanche Electric Cooperative Association. Each of these were key in developing and approving the Brown County Community Wildfire Protection Plan (which we started working on in January 2024, approved in September 2024), which was a prerequisite for applying for this grant.
